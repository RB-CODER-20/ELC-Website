  <h3 id="paraOne">What is an ELC class?<h3> 
  <h4>An <strong>ELC</strong> class is an <em>Enhanced Learning Class</em>. Usually, if your marks and grades are always or mostly above average, they take you in this program. Then, after doing a few tests, you will be informed if you are capable and allowed to join the program. At the end, they find a school that hosts this program, and confirms your spot.</h4>

  <h3 id="paraTwo">Why should I try to get accepted?</h3>
  <h4>You should apply into this program because this program can help you to apply to better high school programs, which can help you to apply to better universities, and that will help you in your life. For example, if you state you are in the ELC program, and your opposition is not, this will make them want to select you in their program/school.</h4>
  <h4>Also, this program improves many of your skills. From intellectual, all the way to behaviour. This program will help you in many many ways. And you never have to worry about mistakes. Every one makes mistakes, but the point of this class is not to prove you wrong, but to <em>help you be right.</em></h4>
  
  <h3 id="paraThree">Objectives</h3>
<h4>The ELC has many objectives which usually are related to improving ourselves more than the amount we improve in normal classrooms. Some of these objectives are:</h4>
<li>Critical Thinking and Creative Thinking</li>
<li>Problem Solving Skills</li>
<li>Planning, Organizing, and Evaluating skills</li>
<li>Independent learning</li>
<li>Self and Group Awareness</li>
<li>Try to learn more about the regular curriculum, than just doing the work</li>

<h3 id="paraFour">Rules</h3>
<h4>Just because we are an enhanced learning class, does not mean we do not follow the rules. Some of the basic and crucial rules that ELC should follow like a regular class are:</h4>
<li>No use of offensive language such as swear words</li>
<li>No harmful activity such as fighting or hitting</li>
<li>No bullying in <em><strong>any</em></strong> form</li>
<li>No lying and cheating</li>
<li>No using materials as weapons</li>
<li>No using devices for unappropriate uses</li>

<h3 id="paraFive">The 3 Tier System in Peel</h3>
<h4>What the 3 Tier System in Peel(Brampton, Caledon, and Mississauga) are 3 different school problems. The 3 different programs are:</h4>
<li>Regular School Program</li>
<li>In-School Enhanced Learning Program(ISELP)</li>
<li>Enhanced Learning Class(ELC)</li>
  
  <h4>The regular school program is the normal classroom with students who follow the common grade  curriculum.</h4>
  <h4>ISELP however, is basically the pathway to ELC, it helps improve characteristics such as the ones listed in the <a href="#paraThree">"Objective"</a> section of this website/article. It is provided in every Peel school.</h4>
  <h4>"ELCs are a Special Education placement option for students whose needs require extensive programming support and differentiated instruction beyond mainstream class programming or the In School Enhanced Learning Program (ISELP).", written on the official BYOD(Paired with Peel) website. â€‹</h4>
  
  <h3 id="paraSix">Final Statement of all ELC Classes</h3>

<h4>So to conclude, I think we should all try to get accepted into the ELC program as it obviously has greater advantages for whomever are in the programn. Thanks for reading!</h4>
